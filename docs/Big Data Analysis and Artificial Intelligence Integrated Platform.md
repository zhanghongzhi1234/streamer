# Big Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence Integrated Platform

## Background
"Big data analysis and artificial intelligence integrated platform" provides a scalable and easy-to-expandable basic platform component system, and provides core technology innovations such as data collection, storage, processing, and analysis for industrial enterprises. Combining with its typical industrial requirements, it has broken through the core technologies of high-end new industrial software such as industrial big data mechanism model modeling technology, knowledge reasoning technology, simulation testing, and parallel analysis and processing, so as to realize the reliable storage and processing of massive industrial data and improve the Data products and system supply capabilities, and effectively guarantee the security of industrial data and industrial systems.

User companies, relying on the industrial big data platform construction capabilities provided by this system, quickly deploy their basic component systems on their private clouds or shared clouds, and build security based on the configuration data and workflow, and the development of necessary data protocol microservices. , A credible industrial big data platform Unicom network to realize a data-driven industrial manufacturing enterprise business model.

## Introduce
Industrial Internet big data analysis and artificial intelligence general integrated platform system is based on information-physical system (CPS), industrial big data platform and fault prediction and health management (PHM) concepts, combined with IoT, big data analysis, collaborative optimization, visualization and other technologies The formed intelligent system provides application technology support for business scenarios such as remote operation and maintenance, intelligent services, intelligent manufacturing, intelligent design and networked coordinated manufacturing, and promotes the transformation and upgrading of traditional manufacturing to service-oriented manufacturing.

## Target
Under the premise of meeting the infrastructure proposed in the "Big Data Standardization White Paper (2018 Edition)", the main goal is to highlight the versatility of the development of a functional module, compatibility with various cloud services, and reduce the difference of user interfaces at different industry levels. ; At the same time, take into account the rapid upgrade and deployment capabilities of the system;

## Features
1.  Data collection layer: Massive industrial time series data can be sent continuously for 7*24 hours. Data collection for structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, while taking into account scalability and processing performance.
2.  Data storage and management: adopt distributed storage technology to build time series data storage, structured data storage and unstructured data storage that can scale horizontally and linearly in performance and capacity. Taking into account the construction of data model management, data quality management, data asset management, data security management and data sharing management technology systems.
3.  Data analysis layer: Parallel computing technology, stream computing technology and data science computing technology are used for basic big data computing technology and big data analysis services. Complete big data analysis service functions to manage and dispatch industrial big data analysis, and form knowledge accumulation through data modeling, data calculation, and data analysis, so as to realize the intelligentization of industrial big data for the production process, product intelligence, new business mode and new model intelligence Data analysis in the fields of integration, management intelligence, and service intelligence. Big data analysis service functions include analysis model management, visual orchestration, analysis job management, industry-specific/general algorithm library and analysis service release
4. Data service layer: externally provide service-oriented access interfaces and functions for all raw data, processing data and analysis result data in the big data platform; data analysis services externally provide real-time stream processing models, mechanism models, and mechanisms accumulated on the big data platform The service interface of statistical model and machine learning model.
5. Data application layer: general data visualization technology and data application development components. Using the microservice development framework and mobile application development tools, the secondary development and iteration of industrial big data applications based on industrial big data management and analysis technology can be quickly realized, and the quality, cost, and efficiency can be improved.

### Industry customization and versatility:

AI empowerment: The industrial Internet platform composed of industrial big data and artificial intelligence will provide enabling products across the value chain for intelligent manufacturing, including industrial IoT platforms for data collection and industrial big data platforms for data aggregation and business enablement , Industrial intelligence platform realizes business forecast optimization, etc., and supports the development of business closed-loop-oriented industrial apps. This will help traditional enterprises to achieve transformation and upgrading, and "leapfrog" into the era of Industry 4.0 and the Industrial Internet.
